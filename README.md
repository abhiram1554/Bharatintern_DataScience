# Titanic Classification Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset, which is often used for binary classification problems.

## Project Overview

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, leading to the deaths of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This project aims to predict the likelihood of survival of the passengers based on various features such as age, sex, ticket class, and more.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle and includes the following features:

* PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger
* Survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
* Name: Name of the passenger
* Sex: Gender
* Age: Age in years
* SibSp: Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
* Parch: Number of parents / children aboard the Titanic
* Ticket: Ticket number
* Fare: Passenger fare
* Cabin: Cabin number
* Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
  
## Steps and Methodology

* Data Exploration: Understanding the dataset and visualizing the distributions and relationships between features.
* Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature engineering.
* Model Building: Trying out different machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.) to find the best model.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model parameters to improve performance.
* Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

# TASK-2

# SMS Classifier
This project aims to develop an SMS Classifier to categorize text messages as either spam or ham (not spam). The classifier is built using machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) to effectively distinguish between spam and legitimate messages.

### Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to create a robust SMS spam detection system that can accurately identify and filter out spam messages. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms and text processing techniques, this classifier provides an efficient solution for spam detection in SMS communications.

#### Features
* Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the SMS text data for analysis.
* Feature Extraction: Extracting relevant features from the text using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Count Vectorization.
* Model Training: Training a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) on the preprocessed and feature-extracted text data.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Prediction: Classifying new SMS messages as spam or ham using the trained model.
